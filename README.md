# Python_BI_2022
This repository contains the homeworks for the Python course (September-December, 2022) in the Bioinformatics Institute. 

##Homework_1
Homework_1 or collection homework is dedicated to an utility that work with exclusively DNA sequences. Provided utilite reads commands from the user in an infinite loop
and then request the sequence, apply the command and print the result (result is also saved in a txt-file). 

###Program launch
To launch the utility download .py scripts and run the program in terminal using `python collection_hw1.py` or `python collection_hw2.py` command. 

###Program commands
The utility accepts the following commands: 
`transcribe` --- print the transcribed sequence;
`reverse` --- print reverse sequence;
`complement` --- print complement sequence;
`reverse complement` --- print reverse complement sequence;
`exit` --- exit the program. 

###Requirements
- The program preserves letter case.
- Only nucleotid acid sequences are allowed. In case of inappropriate symbols collection_hw1.py ask to enter the sequence again and collection_hw2.py ask to reenter
the command.
